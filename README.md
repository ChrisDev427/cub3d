Cub3D is a project from school 42 that aims to recreate a video game engine using the C programming language.
It is inspired by the famous game Wolfenstein 3D, released in 1992.
The main objective of the project is to create a 3D maze in which the player can move and interact with the environment.

To achieve this, students must implement several key features.
They need to create a graphical interface using the miniLibX, a graphics library specific to shcool 42.
This graphical interface allows displaying the visual representation of the maze using the raycasting technique,
which simulates a 3D projection from a first-person view.

Next, students must set up a collision system to manage interactions between the player and the maze walls.
They must also implement a texture system to dress the walls of the maze.
In addition to that, students need to handle player movement, position within the maze, and first-person vision.
They must also integrate gameplay elements such as managing keyboard events to allow the player to move and rotate the camera.

In summary, Ã‰cole 42's Cub3D project is a practical exercise that challenges students to create their own game engine using the C language.
It allows them to explore fundamental concepts in graphics programming and develop their skills in image manipulation, movement,
collisions, and interactions to create a 3D game.
